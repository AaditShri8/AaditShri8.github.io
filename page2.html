        <h1>Where I've Lived</h1>
        I am currently living in my 4th city and 7th house.
        <h2>Cincinnati</h2>
        <p>I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. I lived there for 2 years. I lived in one big house there. There was a lot of space outside and inside the house and there was a creek at the backyard. I went to 3 toddler schools. I do not remember the name of the schools.</p>
        <h2>Boston</h2>
        <p>I lived in Boston, Massachusetts for 5 years. For 2 years I lived in a red brick house which we rented from a friend. Then, we moved to a blue house for a year. Then we moved to a grey house for 2 years. I went to school in a nursery school and went to elementary school for 1 year. The school names were both Cambridge Montessori.</p>
        <h2>Scarsdale</h2>
        <p>I lived in Scarsdale, New York for almost a year. I lived in a grey house with a really cool room painted like a jungle next to the ocean. There was a very nice backyard where me and my sister could play adventure games. The school name was Edgewood School.</p>
        <h2>Short Hills</h2>
        <p>I lived in Short Hills, New Jersey now for about 3 years. I lived in a small house with only two floors for 1 year. It was right next to Glenwood School which I went to for 2 years, the second year spent in a tall stone and gray slate house. I went to Washington School in 5th grade. I finished elementary school on june 14, 2019.</p>
